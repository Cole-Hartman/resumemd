ResumeMD Pitch Script

Have you ever struggled with formatting a resume in Word? Constantly fighting with margins, spacing, and formatting? 
For developers, this process is especially frustrating. Being forced to use clunky word processors for one of our most important professional documents is unacceptable.


That's why I created ResumeMD – a developer-friendly resume creation platform that leverages the simplicity of markdown. 
With ResumeMD, you can create beautiful, professional resumes using the same markdown syntax you already know. 
No more fighting with Word documents or dealing with complex formatting tools.


Some Features Will Be:
- Simple markdown syntax for rapid resume creation
- Custom CSS styling for unlimited personalization
- Version control compatibility – track changes like code
- Multiple export options including PDF and HTML
- Template sharing within the developer community


With over 27 million developers globally and the tech job market constantly evolving, the need for efficient resume tools has never been greater. 
ResumeMD isn't just a resume builder – it's a platform built by developers, for developers, that transforms the resume creation process into a familiar, code-like experience.


Our goal is to improve the way we manage and build our resumes.
